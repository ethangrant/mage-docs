# mage-docs

Mage-Docs is a CLI tool written in Go, designed to generate a `README.md` file for Magento 2 modules. By extracting key information directly from the module, Mage-Docs helps developers quickly create comprehensive and consistent documentation. It can also be useful for reviewing new modules providing a high level overview.

## Features

mage-docs can document the following aspects of a Magento 2 module:

- Module name and its dependencies
- Routes and API routes
- Utilised layouts
- Implemented mixins
- Database schemas
- Events dispatched
- Registered observers
- Plugins
- Preferences

## Installation

mage-docs is written in Go and has been compiled into an executable. See the latest releases to download mage-docs.

When you run mage-docs, you will be guided through a series of prompts to configure the documentation process:
